**ForwardMovingGame**

Ironically, the player doesn't move forward in this game.
The tiles on the board move down towards the player. 
The player dodges obstacles and collects items on the board.
Collecting items allows the player to traverse different objects.

This aims to be improved in a way that so that it is themed, and demonstrates an imaginative use of design.
The game mechanics are also highly likely to be changed; or made into a different project.
